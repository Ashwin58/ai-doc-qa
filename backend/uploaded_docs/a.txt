The Lion

The lion is a wild animal known as the king of the jungle. It is a strong and brave animal that lives in forests and grasslands. Lions have a golden-yellow body, sharp teeth, and strong paws. The male lion has a big mane around its neck, which makes it look majestic.

Lions live in groups called prides. They hunt other animals like deer and zebras for food. The lioness, or female lion, usually does the hunting while the male guards the group.

Lions are found mostly in Africa and some parts of India. They sleep during the day and hunt at night. Although they are dangerous, lions are also very beautiful and powerful creatures. Many people love watching lions in zoos and wildlife parks.

The lion is a symbol of courage and strength. It teaches us to be brave and fearless. That is why it is called the king of the jungle.
